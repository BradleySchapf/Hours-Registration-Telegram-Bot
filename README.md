# Hours Registration Telegram Bot - Dev

This telegram bot is designed to make registering hours for the WORK drive easy and efficient. 

The bot is built in C#, and the backend uses a Microsoft SQL Server.

Unfortunately the bot was built in a tight time deadline, so the code is messier than I would like it to be. It's also missing proper documentation, and the exception handling is limited, and inconsistent.
